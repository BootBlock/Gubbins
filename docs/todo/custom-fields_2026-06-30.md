# Custom-field templates phases (69–72) — migration squash + custom-field depth (2026-06-30)

> **Living document.** Each phase is implemented in its own worktree/session. Tick the
> `[ ]` boxes as work lands, append a one-paragraph **Outcome** note under each phase when it
> completes (mirroring `docs/dev/deferred-features.md`), and re-schedule — never silently
> drop — any deferred item (tag it → a concrete later phase in `docs/dev/deferred-features.md`).
>
> **Continuation-prompt rule (mandatory).** When a phase (or a parallel wave) completes you
> **must** do **both** before ending the session:
>
> 1. **Emit the next wave's kick-off prompt directly in the chat reply** as a **raw, fenced
>    Markdown code block** (a ```` ```text ```` block the user can copy verbatim into a new
>    chat). It is the **last thing** in the reply. Do not merely say "added it to the doc".
> 2. **Record that same prompt** under [Continuation prompt](#continuation-prompt) at the foot
>    of this doc (replacing the previous one).
>
> The two must be **identical**. When the final wave completes, emit a "**Plan complete — no
> continuation**" note as a raw fenced block instead.

## Why these phases exist

The second 2026-06-30 feature audit (auto-memory `feature-gap-audit-2026-06-30b`) named
**category custom-field templates** the highest-leverage remaining gap vs. InvenTree parameter
templates / Sortly custom fields. **On entry to this plan the foundation was found already
shipped** (verified 2026-06-30):

| Capability | Already exists as |
| --- | --- |
| Typed field *definitions*, category-scoped | `category_fields` table (migration **v3**), STRICT, synced; `field_type ∈ {TEXT, NUMBER, BOOLEAN, DATE, SELECT}` (`repositories/constants.ts`) |
| Per-item field *values* (EAV, lenient-defaulting) | `item_field_values` (v3), `UNIQUE (item_id, field_id)`, synced, tombstoned |
| Definitions CRUD + reorder + value get/set/resolve | `CategoryRepository` (`addField`/`updateField`/`deleteField` with `position`; `resolveItemFields`/`setItemFieldValues`) |
| Sync wiring | `SYNC_TABLES` + `FK_REFS` (CASCADE) already carry both tables; §7.5 cascade-of-cascade handled in `reconcile.ts`; HA bridge exposes them |
| Definitions-management UI | `CategoryManagerDialog.tsx` |
| Per-item editor UI | `CustomFieldsEditor.tsx` (one typed input per `field_type`, wired into item detail) |

Building the originally-specced `custom_field_definitions`/`custom_field_values` tables +
a `CustomFieldRepository` would have been a **second parallel synced EAV system** — a
"second write path" the standing protocols forbid. **Developer decision (2026-06-30): build on
the existing tables.** This plan therefore drops the redundant "new schema + new repo + per-item
editor" phases and targets only the genuine residual gaps, confirmed absent by search:

1. **No typed-validation seam.** `setItemFieldValues` stores raw strings; NUMBER/DATE are not
   validated, `SELECT ∈ options` and `is_required` are not enforced at save. There is no pure
   `validateFieldValue`. This is the foundation the CSV import path must validate through.
2. **No search / filter on custom fields.** Nothing in `src/features/search/` touches
   `item_field_values`; a `field:value` predicate cannot be expressed.
3. **No CSV import/export of custom fields.** The Phase-67 `catalog-import.ts` and the Export
   Wizard map only core item fields, not custom-field columns.

Orthogonally, the app is **pre-release with disposable developer-only data**, so the 24-step
migration history carries no upgrade-path value — **Phase 69 squashes it to a single `v1`
baseline** (the migration *engine* stays; it is the load-bearing release upgrade path / fresh-device
sync-clone / backup-restore mechanism).

Everything else from the audit that is out of scope for a local-first single-user PWA
(multi-user/roles, FX, AI forecasting, POS/RFID, accounting, generic REST/webhook beyond the HA
bridge) remains unpursued. Advanced analytics (ABC / turnover / aging) and label customisation
stay parked for a possible later plan.

## Numbering note

The inventory-depth (59–62) and combined a11y + inventory-breadth (64–68) plans are **COMPLETE**
and merged; `main` enters this plan at **`user_version` 24, 1626 unit tests / 157 files**,
`test.pool = 'threads'`. This plan continues the sequence at **Phase 69**. After Phase 69's squash
the schema-version *number* resets to **1**, but the phase numbering continues monotonically.

## Execution model — worktrees, sub-agents, code-review gates

These phases obey the standing protocols (§8): strict phasing, autonomous TDD (§8.2),
`:memory:` node:sqlite unit tests + a real-browser smoke step (§8.5), derive-don't-store seams,
pure `.ts` logic split out of glue (mirror `cycle-count.ts` / `reorder-policy.ts` /
`asset-lifecycle.ts` / `operational-metadata.ts`), **British English**, **design tokens only**
(CLAUDE.md — reach for Foundry primitives first; no raw colour/easing literals), a PHASE_HANDOVER
per phase (§8.1), and **NEVER COMMIT SECRETS** (public repo). On top of that, this plan is
**parallelised**:

- **One git worktree per phase**, implemented by a dedicated **implementation sub-agent**
  (`Agent`, `isolation: "worktree"`), so concurrent phases never share a working tree. Each agent,
  **before any work**, MUST: (1) verify its worktree base is current `main` and `git rebase main`
  if not (the harness may branch from an old commit); (2) if `node_modules` is absent, junction it
  from the main checkout via PowerShell `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path node_modules -Target
  P:\Source\TypeScript\Gubbins\node_modules` (Git Bash `mklink /J` mangles the flag); (3) confirm
  the toolchain with `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` (build-mode `tsc -b` cannot write
  `.tsbuildinfo` through a junction). Strict file isolation: each agent touches **only** its
  surface files + their tests, and runs its own browser smoke step.
- **Code-review gate after every phase (mandatory).** When an implementation sub-agent reports
  done, run a **review sub-agent** against *that worktree's diff* **before merge**. Every finding
  is fixed or explicitly waived in the Outcome note. No phase merges to `main` un-reviewed.
- **Merge discipline.** Octopus/sequential-merge a wave's reviewed branches onto an integration
  branch (disjoint files merge cleanly), junction `node_modules`, run `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json
  --noEmit` + the full `npm run test:run`, then merge to `main`. **GOTCHA:** every phase appends a
  step to `scripts/browser-smoke.mjs`; the conflicting blocks each open `await step(async () => {`
  sharing ONE trailing `});` — resolve by **closing each step explicitly** (a blind "delete the
  markers" union leaves the first step unclosed). **Remove each worktree's `node_modules` junction
  (`cmd /c rmdir …\node_modules`) BEFORE `git worktree remove`**; then `git worktree prune` and
  delete merged branches. Later waves branch from updated `main`.
- **Test gotcha.** A Vitest-4 + `QueryClientProvider` `unhandledRejection` interception blocks
  end-to-end rejected-promise error tests — assert on success/empty, or test the error path in a
  QueryClient-free component.

### Migration-version allocation (collision-avoidance)

| Phase | Migration | `user_version` after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 69 — Migration baseline consolidation | **squash v1…v24 → single `v1-initial`**; engine kept | **1** |
| 70 — Custom-field validation seam + save-time hardening | **none** (tables already exist) | 1 |
| 71 — Search / filter on custom fields | **none** | 1 |
| 72 — CSV import/export of custom fields | **none** | 1 |

Only Phase 69 touches the migration registry (it *replaces* it). Phases 70–72 add no schema. After
the squash the strict-contiguity guard is trivially satisfied (single v1). Trivial merge clashes
(`index.ts` / `SYNC_TABLES` in `tombstone.ts` / `FK_REFS` in `reconcile.ts` / the repository
barrel) resolve by keeping both lines in ascending order — but note Phases 70–72 should not need to
touch any of those.

### Dependency graph & waves

```
Wave 1:            69 (migration squash — run ALONE first; merge before any feature work).
Wave 2:            70 (validation seam + save-time hardening — the foundation the CSV path
                      validates through; run alone).
Wave 3 (parallel): 71 (search / filter on custom fields)   72 (CSV import/export of custom fields)
```

- **69** rewrites the migration registry — must land alone and first, so every later worktree
  branches from a `main` that already carries the single `v1` baseline.
- **70** introduces the pure `validateFieldValue` seam that **72**'s import path validates through,
  so it merges before Wave 3.
- **71 ⟂ 72** — independent surfaces (search vs CSV); safe to run concurrently. Only the shared
  `scripts/browser-smoke.mjs` append conflicts (resolve per the GOTCHA above).

So: run **Wave 1 = {69}**, review + merge; **Wave 2 = {70}**, review + merge; then
**Wave 3 = {71, 72}** in two parallel worktrees, review + merge each. Code review after *every*
phase regardless of wave. After every merge run `npm run test:run` (+ `npm run build` where
relevant) and report the result plainly.

## Phase 69 — Migration baseline consolidation (squash v1…v24 → single `v1`; engine KEPT)

* **Objective.** Collapse the 24-step history into **one** baseline migration that builds the
  entire current schema, removing the accumulated per-step files/tests. Pre-release + disposable
  data ⇒ no upgrade path from old versions is needed. The migration **engine, registry,
  contiguity guard, cold-start retry wrapper, `SYNC_TABLES` and `FK_REFS` all STAY** — only the
  historical step files are consolidated.
* **Method.**
  1. From a freshly-migrated `:memory:` DB on current `main`, dump the canonical schema —
     `SELECT type, name, sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE sql IS NOT NULL ORDER BY type, name`, plus
     per-table `PRAGMA table_info` / `foreign_key_list` / `index_list`, and `user_version` — and
     commit it as a **GOLDEN snapshot fixture**.
  2. Author a single `v1-initial` (version 1) whose statements recreate **exactly** that schema
     (all tables, indexes, the §7.1 auto-stamp triggers, FTS, the `item_stock`/`stock_batches`
     projection triggers, etc.) in dependency order.
  3. Delete `v2…v24` migration + test files and their imports from `index.ts`;
     `TARGET_SCHEMA_VERSION` becomes 1.
  4. **Golden-equivalence test:** a fresh DB built by the new baseline reproduces the committed
     snapshot byte-for-byte (tables, indexes, triggers, FKs, `user_version = 1`).
  5. Ensure a fresh OPFS DB boots cleanly at v1; note in the Outcome that the developer wipes
     their disposable dev DB (it currently sits at v24 and **cannot** upgrade to a v1 baseline —
     that is fine and intended).
* **Constraints.** Do **NOT** change runtime schema/behaviour (the snapshot is the contract). Keep
  the engine, the contiguity guard, the `run-unit-tests.mjs` cold-start retry wrapper. No feature
  change.
* **Tests.** The golden-equivalence test; all surviving feature/repository tests still green (the
  deleted files are only the per-step migration tests). Expect the unit-test **COUNT to DROP**
  (≈ −23 migration tests, +1 equivalence test) — **report the new baseline**. +1 smoke step: a
  clean boot reaches the app.
* **Deliverables checklist.**
  - [x] golden schema snapshot fixture committed
  - [x] single `v1-initial` baseline recreating the full current schema in dependency order
  - [x] `v2…v24` migration + test files removed; `index.ts` imports/registry pruned; `TARGET_SCHEMA_VERSION` → 1
  - [x] golden-equivalence test (fresh build ≡ snapshot, byte-for-byte; `user_version = 1`)
  - [x] engine / contiguity guard / cold-start retry wrapper / `SYNC_TABLES` / `FK_REFS` intact
  - [x] new unit-test baseline reported; +1 boot smoke step
  - [x] code review passed; PHASE_HANDOVER updated; Outcome note appended; auto-memory updated

> **Outcome (2026-06-30, Wave 1 — merged `6275c36`).** Shipped as specified. The 24-step history is
> collapsed into a single `v1-initial` (`version: 1`, `name: 'initial-baseline'`); `v2…v24` migration
> + test files (46 files) are deleted and `index.ts` is pruned to `[v1Initial]` so `TARGET_SCHEMA_VERSION`
> derives to **1**. **Method decision (reviewer-scrutinised, sound):** rather than hand-folding the
> v2…v24 `ALTER`s into clean `CREATE`s, the baseline **re-issues the exact original ordered statement
> stream** (all CREATE + ALTER statements, minus the per-step `user_version` bumps). SQLite stores an
> `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` by appending the column to the *tail* of the table's original stored `CREATE`,
> so only re-issuing the original stream reproduces `sqlite_master.sql` **byte-for-byte** — which the
> hard zero-drift contract requires. A committed golden fixture
> (`src/db/migrations/__fixtures__/schema-baseline.snapshot.json`, generated from the **original v1…v24
> chain**) + `v1-initial.test.ts` deep-equal all 107 `sqlite_master` objects and every table's
> `table_info`/`foreign_key_list`/`index_list`; the fresh baseline boots `0→1`, `applied=[1]`. The
> engine, `assertValidSequence` contiguity guard, `migration.ts`, the `run-unit-tests.mjs` cold-start
> retry wrapper, `SYNC_TABLES` and `FK_REFS` are **untouched**. The two SELECT-based backfills
> (`item_stock`←items, `stock_batches`←item_stock) and the system-location/`sync_meta` seeds are correct
> no-ops/seeds on a fresh empty DB. **Test baseline: 1626/157 → 1492/135** (−46 deleted migration test
> files net of the deletions, +1 equivalence test; the lower count is the removed per-step assertions);
> `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` clean; `npm run build` clean (precache 3227.19 KiB, no budget).
> **Code review: CLEAN-WITH-NITS**, verified zero-drift **bidirectionally** (new baseline ≡ fixture, and
> the original chain ≡ fixture — proving the fixture is a genuine contract, not self-proving). **Two NITs
> waived:** (1) the +1 browser-smoke step asserts the always-mounted Inventory result-count region, which
> proves the workspace painted but is slightly weaker than a completed-query assertion — the preceding
> "Add item" wait already proves a clean migrated boot; (2) the retained backfill `INSERT`s are dead
> weight on an empty DB — kept deliberately so the stream is a faithful re-issue (documented in the file
> header). **Developer action:** existing dev DBs sit at `user_version = 24` and **cannot** "upgrade" to
> a v1 baseline (the engine only applies migrations *newer* than current) — developers must **wipe** their
> disposable local OPFS DB so it re-creates from the baseline. Intended, pre-release. The browser smoke
> could not run end-to-end in the junctioned worktree (Vite `server.fs.allow` won't serve the
> `sqlite-wasm` binary from outside the worktree root) — the squash is fully validated by the 1492 unit
> tests on the real FTS5-capable `node:sqlite` engine + the byte-identical equivalence proof; the added
> step parses (`node --check`) and follows the existing `await step(...)` structure.

## Phase 70 — Custom-field validation seam + save-time hardening (no migration)

* **Objective.** Make custom-field values **typed-valid at the point of save**, on the existing
  `category_fields`/`item_field_values` system — the foundation the CSV import path (Phase 72)
  validates through. No new tables, no second write path.
* **Pure seam.** `src/features/inventory/custom-fields.ts` —
  - `validateFieldValue(def, raw)` → `{ ok: true; value: string | null } | { ok: false; error: string }`
    (never throws): coerce/normalise by `field_type` — NUMBER → finite number (re-serialised
    canonically), BOOLEAN → `'true'`/`'false'`, DATE → ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, SELECT → must be ∈
    `options`, TEXT → trimmed; empty/blank ⇒ `value: null` (clears the row, never stores `''`);
    `is_required` enforced (blank → error). Returns the **storage string** (values persist as TEXT).
  - `fieldsForCategory(defs, categoryId)` → the category's defs in `position` order. **Categories
    are flat** (`CategoryRow` has no `parent_id`) — document "no ancestor resolution; flat model".
  - Pure, injectable, **no DB**. Unit-tested across every type + required + boundary.
* **Repository.** Wire validation into `CategoryRepository.setItemFieldValues` so a bad value is
  rejected with a `DbError` (or the caller validates first) — keep the existing UUID-id +
  `UNIQUE (item_id, field_id)` upsert / tombstone-on-clear path; **do not** switch to a deterministic
  id (needless churn; the UNIQUE constraint already gives LWW-correct sync). `:memory:` tests.
* **UI.** Harden `CustomFieldsEditor.tsx`: validate each field via `validateFieldValue` before save,
  block save on a required-but-empty or invalid field, surface errors accessibly
  (`role="alert"` sibling of the label, per the Phase-51 pattern). Foundry primitives, design
  tokens, British English. (The definitions-management `CategoryManagerDialog` may also adopt the
  seam where it validates option lists — keep changes minimal and in-surface.)
* **Tests.** pure-seam (every type + required + coercion + SELECT-not-in-options + DATE/NUMBER
  malformed) + repository `:memory:` (reject invalid, clear-to-null, round-trip); smoke: set a
  NUMBER custom field on an item, reopen, assert it persisted (and a bad value is blocked).
* **Deliverables checklist.**
  - [x] `custom-fields.ts` pure seam (`validateFieldValue` + `fieldsForCategory`) + tests
  - [x] validation wired into `CategoryRepository.setItemFieldValues` + `:memory:` tests
  - [x] `CustomFieldsEditor` hardening (required/typed validation, `role="alert"` errors)
  - [x] +1 browser smoke step
  - [x] code review passed; PHASE_HANDOVER updated; Outcome note appended; auto-memory updated

> **Outcome (2026-06-30, Wave 2 — merged `0f5c694`).** Shipped as specified, on the existing
> `category_fields`/`item_field_values` tables — **no migration, no second write path**. The pure seam
> `src/features/inventory/custom-fields.ts` exports `validateFieldValue(def, raw)` (never throws —
> returns `{ ok:true; value:string|null } | { ok:false; error }`) and `fieldsForCategory(defs, categoryId)`
> (filter + `position`-then-name order, mirroring the repo's `ORDER BY`; documents the **flat, no-ancestor**
> model). Coercion is **canonical**: NUMBER via `String(Number(text))` behind a `Number.isFinite` gate
> (`'1.50'`→`'1.5'`, `'01'`→`'1'`, `'1e3'`→`'1000'`; `'1.2.3'`/`'abc'`/`±Infinity`/`NaN` rejected) — hex
> (`'0x10'`→`'16'`) and exponent forms are accepted as the finite numbers they denote (documented + tested);
> DATE is **hand-parsed** from `YYYY-MM-DD` with explicit month/day bounds + a Gregorian leap-year check
> (rejects `2026-02-30`/`2026-13-40`/`2025-02-29`), never the lenient `Date` constructor; BOOLEAN
> normalises case-insensitively to `'true'`/`'false'`; SELECT enforces `∈ options`; blank ⇒ `null` (clears
> the row, never stores `''`), `is_required` blank ⇒ error. Anything time-related is injected (`opts.now`,
> reserved). **Repository:** `setItemFieldValues` now widens its one field-membership query from
> `SELECT id` to `SELECT *` → `Map<fieldId, CategoryField>` via the existing `rowToCategoryField`, validates
> each value, throws `DbError('SQLITE_CONSTRAINT', …)` on failure and **persists the coerced value**; the
> UUID-id + `UNIQUE(item_id, field_id)` upsert / tombstone-on-clear path is unchanged (no deterministic-id
> churn). **UI:** `CustomFieldsEditor` validates every changed field through the same seam, disables Save
> while any field is invalid/required-empty, and renders a `role="alert"` error as a **sibling of the
> label** wired via the existing `fieldAria` seam (Phase-51 a11y) across all control types; design tokens
> (`text-destructive`) + British English throughout; `CategoryManagerDialog` untouched. **Tests: 1492/135
> → 1515/136** (+1 file, +18 tests: full pure-seam matrix + 5 repo `:memory:` tests — reject-invalid,
> canonical-persist `'1.50'`→`'1.5'`, clear-to-null still tombstones); `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json
> --noEmit` clean; `npm run build` clean (precache 3228.89 KiB, no budget). **Code review: CLEAN-WITH-NITS.**
> **Two findings fixed pre-merge:** (1) the browser-smoke "invalid value blocks save" sub-assertion was
> unreliable — a native `<input type=number>` drops non-numeric text before the seam sees it, so it proved
> nothing; replaced with the reliable end-to-end fact (a valid `'12.50'` coerces to `'12.5'` and round-trips
> from the worker DB), with the block path left to the pure-seam + `:memory:` tests; (2) the
> exhaustiveness-guard `void _never` was unreachable after the `return` — reordered above it. **Three NITs
> waived:** the reserved-but-unused `opts.now` clock seam (forward-looking, matches sibling modules); the
> documented hex/exponent NUMBER acceptance (harmless for an inventory field, tested); and the sanctioned
> layering import (`CategoryRepository` imports the pure `validateFieldValue`) — no runtime cycle, since
> `custom-fields.ts` imports only the `CategoryField` **type** from `@/db/repositories`. **Smoke status:**
> parse-validated only (`node --check`), not run end-to-end — same known Phase-69 limitation (Vite
> `server.fs.allow` won't serve the `sqlite-wasm` binary from outside the worktree root through the
> junction); the step is authored against real selectors and follows the existing `await step(...)`
> structure. The validation paths are fully proven by the 1515 unit/`:memory:` tests on the real
> FTS5-capable `node:sqlite` engine.

## Phase 71 — Search / filter on custom fields (no migration) — Wave 3, parallel with 72

* **Objective.** Let users filter the inventory by a custom-field value via the existing §5.1
  search.
* **Seam.** Extend `parseTextQuery` / the SearchAST (`src/features/search/`) so a `field:value`
  style token resolves to a custom-field predicate, lowered through the **existing**
  `parseASTtoSQL` (join `item_field_values` / `category_fields` by field name or key). **PRODUCE
  THE AST — never hand-build SQL at the call site** (Phase 47/48 rule). Pure, unit-tested.
* **UI.** Surface custom fields in the filter affordance (`SearchBuilderContext` / builder
  components) where appropriate; the result-count `aria-live` region stays intact.
* **Tests.** parser/AST unit tests (text / number / choice / date predicates, missing-field) + a
  `:memory:` query test (the join returns the right items); smoke: filter by a custom field and
  assert the list narrows.
* **Deliverables checklist.**
  - [x] `field:value` token → SearchAST predicate, lowered through existing `parseASTtoSQL` + tests
  - [x] `:memory:` query test (join `item_field_values` returns expected items)
  - [x] filter-affordance UI surfacing custom fields; result-count `aria-live` intact
  - [x] +1 browser smoke step
  - [x] code review passed; PHASE_HANDOVER updated; Outcome note appended; auto-memory updated

> **Outcome (Phase 71 — Search / filter on custom fields).** Shipped a `field:<name>` search
> predicate that lets the existing §5.1 search filter the inventory by a category custom-field value,
> **with no migration and no new SQL call-site** — the predicate is produced as a `FilterCondition` in
> the §5.1 SearchAST and lowered through the **existing** `parseASTtoSQL`, exactly mirroring the
> `capability:<key>` seam (the Phase 47/48 "produce the AST, never hand-build SQL" rule). A
> custom-field condition lowers to an `EXISTS` over the join `item_field_values ⋈ category_fields`,
> resolving the field by **definition name** (`cf.name` COLLATE NOCASE); since all values persist as
> TEXT in the EAV table, numeric `>`/`<`/`=` cast `ifv.value` to REAL so they order numerically, not
> lexically; CONTAINS escapes LIKE wildcards; presence reuses `HAS_CAPABILITY` ("has any value"). A
> **missing/unknown field name resolves inside the subquery and so matches no rows — no-match, never an
> error**, as required. The hybrid text parser gained the `field:<name>[op<value>]` form (plus the
> `cf:` alias: `:` → CONTAINS, `=` → EQUALS/numeric, `>`/`<` → numeric), still gated through the real
> `parseASTtoSQL` so it can never emit a tree it would reject. The Visual Builder surfaces a new
> **"Custom field"** field option with a free-text "Custom field name" input (mirroring the capability
> key affordance), and the inventory result-count `aria-live` region is untouched. British English,
> Foundry primitives + design tokens only. **Tests +34 (1515→1549) across +1 new file (136→137):**
> parseASTtoSQL AST + `:memory:` join tests (text/number/presence predicates, **case-insensitive name
> resolution**, **unknown-field → no-match**, no-SQL-injection), parse-text-query parser + round-trip
> tests, and a new `fields.test.ts` for the helper/label seam. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`
> **clean**; `npm run build` **clean** (precache 62 entries / 3231.57 KiB, no budget breach). +1 browser
> smoke step (*"filters the inventory by a custom-field value (§5.1, Phase 71)"*) — **parse-validated
> only** (`node --check` passes): run end-to-end it fails like every dev-server step because Vite's
> `server.fs.allow` rejects the junctioned `sqlite-wasm` binary (resolved to the main checkout, outside
> the worktree root) so the app's DB never boots — the documented Phase-69/70 worktree limitation, not a
> Phase-71 defect. **Code review: CLEAN-WITH-NITS** — verified parameterisation (field name + value are
> bound `?` params, no SQL interpolation/injection), the AST-produced-then-lowered discipline, scope
> isolation, and that the `:memory:` tests meaningfully prove the join + numeric REAL-cast + no-match
> behaviour. **Two review nits, both observations (no code change):** (1) `category_fields.name` is not
> UNIQUE, so `field:Rating` is **name-scoped, not category-scoped** — intended "resolve by name" behaviour,
> and `EXISTS` makes duplicate joins harmless; (2) the smoke step is parse-only per the standing worktree
> limitation above. Merged to `main` (`4b84410`).

## Phase 72 — CSV import/export of custom fields (no migration) — Wave 3, parallel with 71

* **Objective.** Extend the Phase-67 catalogue CSV so custom fields import/export alongside core
  fields.
* **Seam.** Extend `catalog-import.ts`'s column-mapping + Zod dry-run so a CSV column can target a
  custom field (validated via the **Phase-70** `validateFieldValue`), applied **through** the
  existing batch-apply + `CategoryRepository.setItemFieldValues` (no second write path). Export adds
  the defined custom-field columns (header = field name/key; one column per definition encountered).
* **Tests.** pure mapping/coercion/error tests (column → field resolution, invalid value collected
  not thrown, required enforced) + `:memory:` batch-apply (the value lands on the item via the
  existing path); smoke: import a CSV with a custom-field column and assert the value lands on the
  item.
* **Deliverables checklist.**
  - [x] `catalog-import.ts` custom-field column mapping + Zod dry-run (validates via Phase-70 seam) + tests
  - [x] batch-apply persists via existing `setItemFieldValues` (no second path) + `:memory:` test
  - [x] Export Wizard catalogue CSV gains custom-field columns
  - [x] +1 browser smoke step
  - [x] code review passed; PHASE_HANDOVER updated; Outcome note appended; auto-memory updated

> **Outcome (shipped).** Phase 72 extends the Phase-67 catalogue CSV so category custom fields import and

> `CustomFieldTarget` (`{ fieldId }`) mapping variant; `inferColumnMapping(headers, customFields?)`
> auto-maps a non-core header to a custom field by normalised name (or raw field id, core synonyms winning a

> `CategoryRepository.setItemFieldValues` (the only write path) — a custom-field write failure (e.g. the
> field is not on the item's category) is recorded on the row without rolling back the item.
> `CatalogImportWizard.tsx` loads every category's `listFields` and threads the defs through inference,
> plan-building and apply. EXPORT: `buildCatalogCsv(items, customFields?, valuesByItem?)` appends one column
> per definition (header = field name, dedup by field id, RFC-4180-quoted), fed by a new
> `collectCustomFieldColumns` in `run-export.ts` that resolves each item's fields via the existing
> `resolveItemFields` read path and exports **stored** values only (lenient defaults left blank so an
> export→import round-trip never pins a default). +18 unit tests (1515 → **1533**, no new files: 14 added to
> `catalog-import.test.ts` incl. a `:memory:` apply test proving the value lands, 5 to `export-data.test.ts`);
> +1 browser-smoke step (*"imports a CSV custom-field column and the value lands on the item (Phase 72)"*).
> `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` **clean**; `npm run build` **clean** (precache 3230.94 KiB, no

> Phase-70 `validateFieldValue` (not re-implemented); export RFC-4180 quoting, dedup-by-field-id, and the
> category-mismatch-records-an-error case are all covered by meaningful tests. **One nit waived → deferred:**
> in the import wizard's MapStep, an *auto-mapped* custom-field column renders its select as `''`

## Deferred / explicitly out of scope

- **New `custom_field_definitions`/`custom_field_values` tables + `CustomFieldRepository`** — the
  feature already exists as `category_fields`/`item_field_values` + `CategoryRepository`; building a
  parallel system was explicitly rejected (no second write path). Closed.
- **Deterministic `${itemId}|${fieldId}` value ids** — the existing UUID + `UNIQUE (item_id,
  field_id)` upsert already gives LWW-correct sync; the change would be needless churn. Not pursued.
- **Hierarchical category field inheritance (ancestor resolution)** — categories are flat
  (`CategoryRow` has no `parent_id`); revisit only if a category tree is introduced.
- Multi-user/roles, FX, AI forecasting, POS/RFID, accounting, generic REST/webhook beyond the HA
  bridge — enterprise-only; not pursued.
- **Advanced analytics (ABC / turnover / aging)** and **label customisation** — confirmed audit
  candidates, parked for a possible later plan.


## Continuation prompt

```text
Plan complete — no continuation.

The Gubbins custom-field-templates plan (docs/todo/custom-fields_2026-06-30.md) is FINISHED. All
four phases are implemented, reviewed and merged to main:

- Phase 69 — migration squash → single v1-initial baseline (merged 6275c36)
- Phase 70 — custom-field validation seam + save-time hardening (merged 0f5c694)
- Phase 71 — search/filter on custom fields: field:<name> token → SearchAST FilterCondition lowered
  through the existing parseASTtoSQL (EXISTS join item_field_values⋈category_fields, name-resolved,
  unknown→no-match, REAL-cast numeric compare, parameterised — no injection); Visual Builder
  custom-field affordance; result-count aria-live intact (merged 4b84410)
- Phase 72 — CSV import/export of custom fields: import validates via the Phase-70 validateFieldValue
  seam through the existing CategoryRepository.setItemFieldValues (no second write path; invalid/
  required collected as row errors, never thrown); export adds one column per definition (dedup by
  field id, RFC-4180 quoted) via resolveItemFields (merged 0922bb4)

End state on main: user_version 1 (no migration after Phase 69); 1567 unit tests / 137 files all
green; npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit clean; npm run build clean (precache 62 entries /
3233.62 KiB, no budget breach). Both Wave-3 phases reviewed CLEAN-WITH-NITS; the only waived nit is
the import-wizard MapStep custom-field column cue (cosmetic/UX — the inferred mapping still applies),
logged in docs/dev/deferred-features.md (Phase 72) as a backlog UX-cue follow-up.

No further work is scheduled under this plan. Advanced analytics (ABC / turnover / aging) and label
customisation remain parked for a possible separate later plan (see "Deferred / explicitly out of
scope" above); pick those up only via a new plan doc if the developer prioritises them.
