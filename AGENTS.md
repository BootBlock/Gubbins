# Agent instructions

This file is the cross-agent (AGENTS.md) entry point. The full working conventions live in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — read it before making changes. The two rules below are mandatory and
repeated here so no agent can miss them.

## 🔒 No secrets in the repository (mandatory)

This is a **public** repository. Committing a secret is treated as a build-breaking error —
secrets are effectively permanent once pushed (they live in history and may be scraped within
seconds), so the only safe rule is to never let one in.

**Hard rules — these are not negotiable:**

- **Never** write an API key, token, password, secret, private key, certificate, OAuth
  client secret, session cookie, or connection string into any tracked file — including
  source, tests, fixtures, docs, comments, config, and commit messages. Use an obvious
  placeholder (`<YOUR_API_KEY>`, `sk-xxxx`) when an example is genuinely needed.
- **Never** commit real personal data: private email addresses, phone numbers, real names
  tied to private accounts, internal hostnames, or IP addresses. Use the GitHub `noreply`
  identity (`BootBlock@users.noreply.github.com`), `example.com` / `*.test` domains, and
  `localhost` in examples and tests.
- **Secrets belong in `.env` only.** `.env` and `.env.*` are git-ignored (keep
  `.env.example` with placeholder values only). Read configuration from the environment at
  runtime — never inline it.
- **Never** commit data artefacts that may carry real content: `*.sqlite`/`*.db`, database
  dumps, exported vaults/archives, `.pem`/`.key`/`.pfx`/`.p12`/keystores, or `id_rsa*`.
- **Before every commit, self-audit the diff.** Run `git diff --cached` and scan for
  anything credential-shaped or personal. If a secret is in doubt, leave it out and ask.
- **If a secret is ever committed, stop.** Treat it as compromised: it must be rotated/revoked
  at the source, and the history scrubbed — removing it in a later commit is **not**
  sufficient. Surface this immediately rather than quietly continuing.

## ⚠️ Use design tokens, not hard-coded values

Every colour and motion value in the UI must come from a **design token**, never a raw hex /
`rgb()` / `oklch()` literal or an ad-hoc Tailwind palette class. See the full table and rules
in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#design-tokens-are-mandatory-where-one-exists).
